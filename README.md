A tutorial for setting up illegal drugslang sentiment analysis using BERT:


This tutorial provides positive and negative based binary sentiment analysis as output based on the sentiment of the text provided.The primary objective of such a project could be to analyze and understand the sentiment of conversations that involve drug slang. By identifying the overall sentiment of these conversations, researchers can gain insights into the attitudes and emotions associated with drug use.
